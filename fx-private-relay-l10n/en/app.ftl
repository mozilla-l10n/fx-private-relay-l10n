## FAQ Page

faq-headline = Frequently Asked Questions

faq-question-1-answer-a = While { -brand-name-relay } does not filter for spam, our email partner Amazon SES does block spam and malware. If { -brand-name-relay } forwards messages you don’t want, you can update your { -brand-name-relay } settings to block messages from the alias forwarding them.  

# Variables:
#   $url (url) - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/private-relay/

faq-question-1-answer-b-html = If you see a broader problem of unwanted email from all of your aliases, please <a href="{ $url }" { $attrs }>report this to us</a> so we can consider adjusting the SES spam thresholds for this service. If you report these as spam, your email provider will see { -brand-name-relay } as the source of spam, not the original sender.
faq-question-2-question = Why won’t a site accept my { -brand-name-relay } alias?

# Variables:
#   $url (url) - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/private-relay/
#   $attrs (string) - specific attributes added to external links
faq-question-2-answer-html = Some sites may not accept an email address that includes a subdomain (i.e., the “relay” portion of @relay.firefox.com) and others have stopped accepting all addresses except those from Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo accounts. 
    As { -brand-name-firefox-relay } grows in popularity and issues more aliases, our service might be placed on a blocklist. 
    If you are not able to use a { -brand-name-relay } alias, <a href="{ $url }" { $attrs }>please let us know</a>.
